lua-sophia is a Lua binding to [Sophia](http://sphia.org) embeddable key-value database.

The database stores only Lua string keys and values, for storing more complex types
use a serialization library, such as MessagePack.

See the documentation in the `doc` folder for usage, or [online](http://mkottman.github.com/lua-sophia).
