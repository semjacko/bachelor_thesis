numlua.buffer(opt [, arg])
--------------------------

Operates on Numlua buffer according to `opt`:

  * `"release"`: release all buffers with size at least `arg`; `arg` defaults
    to 0.
  * `"status"`: returns the total size and number of buffers that are _busy_
    if `arg` is **true** or _free_ otherwise.
