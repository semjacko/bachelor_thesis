mathx.besseli(nu, z, scaling [, n])
-----------------------------------

Returns a `n` member sequence of complex modified Bessel functions of first
kind _CY(j) = I(nu + j - 1, z)_ with nonnegative orders _nu + j - 1_
for _j = 1, ..., n_ and complex `z` in the cut plane _-pi < arg(z) < pi_.
The size of the sequence `n` defaults to 1. A completion `status` is also
returned.

If `scaling` is **true**, returns _CY(j) * exp(-abs(real(z)))_ to remove
the exponential growth in both the left and right half planes.

If `status` is **true**, the return is normal, that is, the computation
completed without errors, underflows, or overflows; otherwise, `status` is
an error message. If no computation is performed, **nil** is returned.
