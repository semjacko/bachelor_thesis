mathx.beta(x, y)
mathx.lbeta(x, y)
-----------------

Computes the beta function `B` with arguments `x` and `y` and its logarithm
(`beta` and `lbeta` respectively.) The beta function is defined by
`B(x, y) = integral_0^1 t^(x - 1) (1 - t)^(y - 1) dt`, or, equivalently, by
`B(x, y) = G(x) * G(y) / G(x + y)` where `G` is the gamma function.
