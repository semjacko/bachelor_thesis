matrix.div(a, b [, right [, inplace]])
--------------------------------------

Performs _element-wise_ division of `a` and `b`. If `b` is a number, sets
`a[i] = a[i] / real(b)` if `a` is real, or `a[i] = a[i] / b` if `a` is
complex; otherwise, sets `a[i] = a[i] / b[i]` if `b` is a conformable
matrix.

If `right` is **true**, `a` is divided in the right, that is, `a = b / a`.
If `inplace` is **true**, `a` is updated _in-place_.
