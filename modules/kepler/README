Kepler 1.1.1
http://www.keplerproject.org

Kepler is a Lua web development platform that offers the same advantages of Lua.
Kepler is simple, portable, light, embeddable and extensible.

The Kepler Platform consists in distributions for Windows, Unix and OSX and allows
the development of Web Applications using WSAPI, Orbit or CGILua technologies;
the user can also choose to use additional modules to support SQL, XML, Zip, MD5 etc.

Kepler uses LuaRocks as its main deployment option, but can be used without LuaRocks
if needed. The best option for deployment without LuaRocks is to first do a normal
deployment (using LuaRocks) in a separate environment, then copying the modules to
the final environment. This is the recommended solution for embedded scenarios
(doing the LuaRocks-based deployment in your cross-compilation environment).

Kepler is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1.
