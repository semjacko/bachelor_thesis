                lsocket - simple and easy socket support for lua

What is it?

   lsocket is a library to provide socket programming support for lua. It
   is not intended to be a complete socket api, but easy to use and good
   enough for most tasks. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported, as are tcp and
   udp, and also IPv4 broadcasts and IPv6 multicasts.

  What's new in versin 1.0-2

     * enhance check of whether a nslookup is needed, should now cover all
       cases
     * modified select() to ignore closed sockets, also calling select()
       without open sockets and without timeout is now an error.
     * added constant _VERSION, which contains the full version number for
       lsocket.
