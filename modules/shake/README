Shake
(http://shake.luaforge.net/)

Shake is a simple and transparent test engine for Lua that assumes that tests only
use standard assert and print calls. If you are looking for a xUnit style framework,
check lunit and luaunit instead.

Shake is distributed as a Lua module, a command line runner and a CGILua application.

Shake is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1.

Current version is 1.0.1. It was developed for Lua 5.1.
