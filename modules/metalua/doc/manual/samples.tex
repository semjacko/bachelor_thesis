\section{Advanced examples}
This section will present the implementation of advanced features. The
process is often the same:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``That language has this nifty feature that would really save my
  day!''
\item Implement it as a metalua macro.
\item ???
\item Profit!
\end{enumerate}

The other common case for macro implementation is the development of a
domain-specific language. I'll eventually write a sample or two
demonstrating how to do this.
