This is a gdbm interface for Lua 5.1. gdbm is the GNU database manager,
a replacement of the UNIX dbm library available at
	http://www.gnu.org/software/gdbm/
If you're running Linux, you probably already have gdbm installed.

To try the library, edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua and
then run make. This will build the library and run a simple test.
For detailed installation instructions, see
	http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/install.html

There is no manual but the library is simple and intuitive; see the summary
below. Read also test.lua, which shows the library in action.

test.lua also provides gdbm.proxy, which creates table proxies for gdbm
databases, and two "for" generators: "keys" and "entries", for convenient
traversal of databases.

This code is hereby placed in the public domain.
Please send comments, suggestions, and bug reports to lhf@tecgraf.puc-rio.br .
