# To-do list for the Lua/APR binding

## New features

 * **Encrypted network communication**. It appears that APR itself doesn't support this but clearly it's possible because there are dozens of projects that use APR and support encrypted network communication (the [Apache HTTP server] [httpd], [ApacheBench] [ab], [Tomcat] [tomcat], etc.)
 * Make it possible to enable text mode for files, pipes and sockets on platforms where there is no distinction between text/binary mode (because `CR` + `LF` â†’ `LF` translation can be useful on UNIX as well)

## Known problems

 * Find out why **`apr.xlate()` doesn't work on Windows** (I can't seem to get `apr_iconv` working on Windows)
    * Zhiguo Zhao mentioned that he's using `apr.xlate()` on Windows using the original `libiconv` instead of `apr_iconv` (see [issue #11] [issue_11])
 * Investigate **escaping problem in `apr_proc_create()`** as found by the test for the `apr.namedpipe_create()` function (see `etc/tests.lua` around line 625)
 * Why is the DBD `LD_PRELOAD` trick needed?! [More information] [dbd_trick]

## Anything else?

 * Propose the [libapreq2 binding] [apreq_binding] for inclusion as the official Lua language binding of [libapreq2] [libapreq2]? (first make the binding a lot more complete)
 * [Maybe][atexit] I shouldn't be using `atexit()` to call `apr_terminate()`? (BTW the whole linked blog post is interesting, as is the follow-up post)
